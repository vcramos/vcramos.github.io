## Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is one of the foundational concepts in statistical modeling and machine learning. It is used to explore and quantify the relationship between two variables:

- Independent Variable (Predictor): This is the variable used to predict the outcome.
- Dependent Variable (Output): This is the variable we want to predict.
The core idea of simple linear regression is to establish a linear relationship between these variables. The relationship is represented as a straight line called the regression line, defined by the equation:

```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)

Y_i = A \cdot X + B

```

Where:

𝑌
𝑖
Y 
i
​
 : Predicted value of the dependent variable for the 
𝑖
i-th observation.
𝑋
X: Value of the independent variable.
𝐴
A: Slope of the line, representing the rate of change in 
𝑌
Y for a one-unit increase in 
𝑋
X.
𝐵
B: Intercept, representing the predicted value of 
𝑌
Y when 
𝑋
=
0
X=0.
This technique is widely used for predictive analysis, as it offers a simple and interpretable model for understanding the relationship between two variables.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```python
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```python
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
